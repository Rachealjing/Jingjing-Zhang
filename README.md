1. Machine learning course: homework_code_Jingjing Zhang.ipynb and Project_code.ipynb
homework_code_Jingjing Zhang.ipynb is the code of my personal homework.
Project_code.ipynb is the code of our team project. In the project,we apply machine learning algorithms to construct prediction of home loan default. We use a large labeled dataset with over 350 thousand, and 220 features consist of loan-specific variables and borrower demographics provided by Home Credit. Different machine learning classification algorithms are applied to predict in the sample (training sample) and to forecast out-of-sample (testing data). These methods are Logistic regression (benchmark), Lasso regression, Na√Øve Bayes model, Neural Network, Random forest, and LightGBM. We find that the performance of the Random forest model and LightGBM model are substantially better than the benchmark model, the logistic regression model.

2. Thesis: returnwithd.py and intradayselect.py
I cleaned daily data of all the stocks listed on NYSE, Amex and Nasdaq, and built momentum portfolio in returnwithd.py
I cleaned intraday data for each stock in intradayselect.py

3. Time Series course: Assignment 1_code_Time series.RPF
we use Rats software in this project.

4. Derivative Product course: Assignment2 _code_Derivative Product.ipynb
I built three-dimensional grid to construct numerical method for option pricing.

5.Portfolio Management course: PM_Project1_partA_Q9.m
It's part of the code of my projects and we use Matlab software.
